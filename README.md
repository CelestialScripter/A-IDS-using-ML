# A-IDS-using-ML
This project was made for Blacksentry Consulting. This is a similar Project with The previous one. However, The Dataset as well as the feature selection technique used differ from previous project. Goal was to use machine learning algorithms for predicting network and web attacks.
This project is more of a prototype, than a final working product.

# Model Used
The Intrusion Detector is built using Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Naive Bayes algorithms which is trained specifically for each individual type of attacks

# Dataset Used
Dataset we used to achieve this goal is UNSW-NB15 dataset. Dataset contains network traffic data during normal traffic and during execution of different attacks.

# How to Run?
Run the file NSL_KDD.ipynb in an IPython Notebook, to trace step by step analysis of what code does
